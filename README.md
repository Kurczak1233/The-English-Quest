# The-English-Quest

It was not so long until I have finished my second project.

The English Quest is my first completed project in ASP .NET Core framework.
It was a pleasant journey, which gave me a lot of self-awareness of my skills and satisfaction. Despite the fact that I have been looking for other projects for resources I feel that I have learned a lot.
I must admit that documentation of entity framework core and .net framework may be somewhat overwhealming sometimes, but it is still better than JQuery documentation...

What I have learned so far?
How WebApi works,
Basic knowledge of .NET 5 framework,
Basics of Jquery, 
Some more knowledge how javascript works,
How does repository pattern look like in a project,
More knowledge about bootstrap framework,
Some more awareness of SOLID principles,
Some more awareness of design patterns like builder.
How depednecy injection works in project.
What are the instances of dependecy injections (scoped, transient, singleton)
Some information about entity framework core functions like user managers, loggers etc.
