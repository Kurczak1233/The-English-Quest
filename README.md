# The-English-Quest

It was not so long until I have finished my second project.
The English Quest is my first completed project in ASP .NET Core framework.
It was a pleasant journey, which gave me a lot of self-awareness of my skills and satisfaction. Despite the fact that I have been looking for other projects for resources I feel that I have learned a lot.
I must admit that documentation of entity framework core and .net framework may be somewhat overwhealming sometimes, but it is still better than JQuery documentation...

What I have learned so far?

How WebApi works,
Basic knowledge of .NET 5 framework,
Basics of Jquery,
How MVC design pattern looks like.
Some more knowledge how javascript works,
How does repository pattern look like in a project,
More knowledge about bootstrap framework,
Some more awareness of SOLID principles,
Some more awareness of design patterns like builder.
How depednecy injection works in project.
What are the instances of dependecy injections (scoped, transient, singleton)
Some information about entity framework core functions like user managers, loggers etc.
Basic knowledge of how to create a functioning relationships in db.
More knowledge of using MS SQL Server, nad SQL.

Problems, consternations, malfunctions.

Of course there are some things that require improvements. I must admit, that projects is in its minimal functional phase. I have no more time to develop this project, even though it has some potential. It requires more differentation in questions (tasks) implementation. I wanted to add commenting functionality, which could give more knowledge of how to create those kind of things and implementing them in db. There are some fragments of code that are not well written. For example, static html page where sample exam test is could be easily rebuilded using javascript, but at the moment I have completly no time to continue developing and refactoring my code. Builder is created on purpose. In my opinion it is not obligatory to use it in that place of project. I have some problems with identifying where is the most appropriate place to use design paterns. Summing up: There are some fields I may improve my application and of course there is a lot more to learn in .NET.
There is one thing to mention. I tried to deploy my project to azure, but I failed miserably. I will have to spend more time learning how to deploy project to azure...

Future.

I am looking towards learning React framework and of course improving javascript.
There is a lot to learn in design patterns field of study. I will definitely focus more on those.
I feel that I should slowly introduce more advanced functionalities in my projects and learn more advanced (and new) C# functionalities.
I will have to create one small desktop project, so I will definitely learn some WPF.
Learn testing finally. In my opinion, programmer is not developer. Developer has to test his applications.
